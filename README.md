# EarthquakeApp

The purpose of this app is to pull in data from a feed hosted by the USGS for earthquakes that have occurred within the last hour and updated every minute.


It contains three views:
 - Summary View - A list of all the data from USGS from the last hour.
 - Detail View - An detail view of every list row.
 - Map View - A general view of all the points in an interactive map.

- It supports any orientation thanks to the Auto-Layout.
- The UI and UX follow the standards of the iOS platform.
- It implements third party libraries like SwiftHTTP and JSONJoy.
- Workspace/project does not have any compile/linking errors or warnings.


Extra Implementations:
- On the Summary View, the app implements a “pull to refresh” feature.
- The app also has a cache earthquake data for use when no connectivity exists.
- The app has a Summary map view to display color coded pins similar to the rows in the Summary view.
